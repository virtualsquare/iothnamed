CLI/configuration option: hash reverse policy always/host/net/never
CLI/configuration option: ttl for hash/revhash (currently it is a constant 600s)
CLI/configuration option: listen backlog for TCP clients
Timeout for idle TCP clients (use shutdown(2) to generate POLLHUP events).
error feedback for net communication startup problems (bind etc)
renew base addresses for hash/otip
sometimes there are sigsegv during the termination.
round robin for forwarding timeouts or errors?
multiple AAAA base addr for otip/hash?
